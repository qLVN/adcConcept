# adcConcept

Making Audencia's Tomorrow service usable on iOS 6.

This app is a concept, intended to be replaced with a definitive version.
For now, it is relying on a basic UIWebView wrapper to show content and only the agenda is implemented and working properly.

In the definitive version, a full coverage of Tomorrow and proper UI (No web wrapper) are planned.

There are no plans to make this work on other iOS versions such as iOS 7. Although it might work on iOS 5 versions and maybe older ones, although not tested.
